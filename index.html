                     My career began  in a civil engineering  firm as an AutoCAD operator using my spare time to code with AutoLISP and scripting. I later  moved into the production sector in the area of Quality Control and manufacturing. During this period I also  ran a small business managing a website and  marketing using SEO.  In the last seven  years I have got back into more of an IT role. This has included general IT support for many people and in the small business arena. Recently I worked in the Quality Department of the Yamaha.  My most recent job ay Yamaha was Admin of the Quality Software in the Jet Boat Division.
