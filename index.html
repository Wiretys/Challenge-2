                     My career began  in a civil engineering  firm as an AutoCAD operator using my spare time to code with AutoLISP and scripting. I later  moved into the production sector in the area of Quality Control and manufacturing. During this period I also  ran a small business managing a website and  marketing using SEO.  In the last seven  years I have got back into more of an IT role. This has included general IT support for many people and in the small business arena. Recently I worked in the Quality Department of the Yamaha.  My most recent job ay Yamaha was Admin of the Quality Software in the Jet Boat Division.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
